<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, it's a Machine Transilation using Transformer from Scratch project </h1>

- #### ðŸŒ± If you want to convert your knowledge about transformer from therotical to practiacal , It' a good step and wish you the best ^ ^
-  ### ðŸ”­ My goals from this project are:

    #####  Practise and increase my experience in PyTorch
    #####  Convert theoretical into practical which will help me when I read Paper imagine the implementation process

- ðŸŒ± Our Dataset is [Opus Books](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Helsinki-NLP/opus_books) which got from HuggingFace

  
- ðŸŒ± Tokenizer model is  -> [WordLevel](https://huggingface.co/robot-test/dummy-tokenizer-wordlevel)
- ðŸŒ± Tokenizer Trainer is -> [WordLevelTrainer](https://huggingface.co/docs/tokenizers/en/api/trainers#tokenizers.trainers.WordLevelTrainer)
- ðŸŒ± Tokenizer - Pre Tokenizer is -> [Whitespace](https://huggingface.co/docs/tokenizers/en/api/pre-tokenizers#tokenizers.pre_tokenizers.Whitespace)

  
- ðŸ”­ This project inheritance from Eng [Umar Jamil](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISNdQcPhsts&t=9999s) . " If you are Non-Arabs, I recommend to focus in theoretical part well before go further "

- ðŸŒ± If you don't know what is the Transformer ? I recommend to watch this video for Eng [Abu Bakr Soliman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JGzwI2pNfo&t=14s) " For Arabs "
